# Pollution Impact & Sprinkling Effectiveness Dashboard — Master Plan

## 1. App Overview & Objectives

**Objective:**
Build a highly usable, impact-focused internal dashboard for municipal corporations to **measure, improve, and act on road-dust mitigation through water sprinkling**. The system prioritizes **before-vs-after impact**, actionable insights, and simple UI over public reporting or AI showmanship.

**What this is not:**

* Not a citizen-facing or PR dashboard
* Not a futuristic or experimental system
* Not a complex analytics platform

**What this is:**

* An operational control panel for ward-level engineers
* A measurement + advisory system to improve AQI outcomes
* A defensible, immediately deployable solution

---

## 2. Target Audience

**Primary User (Day 1):**

* Ward-level Engineer / Supervisor (Municipal Corporation)

**User Characteristics:**

* Action-oriented, time-constrained
* Needs clarity, not charts
* Accountable for routes and contractors
* Uses data to make operational decisions, not presentations

---

## 3. Core Use Case

> “Given current pollution, wind, and road conditions — where should I sprinkle today to get maximum impact, and did yesterday’s sprinkling actually work?”

---

## 4. Core Features & Functionality

### 4.1 Sensor-Based Measurement

* Fixed air-quality sensor units placed along:

  * Dust-prone roads
  * Construction-heavy wards
  * Sprinkler routes (before & after)
* Sensors include:

  * PM2.5 / PM10
  * Humidity (mandatory)
  * Temperature (optional)

### 4.2 Impact Measurement Logic (Locked)

* **Simplest operational model**:

  * Pre-sprinkling PM reading
  * Post-sprinkling PM reading after a fixed time window
* Focuses on **impact**, not absolute AQI compliance

### 4.3 Advisory (Not Directive) Recommendations

* System suggests (engineer decides):

  * Which routes matter most today
  * Best time to sprinkle for maximum impact
* Recommendations are **advisory-only** to ensure adoption and trust

### 4.4 Daily Structured Action Plans

* Three precise plans generated per day:

  * Morning
  * Evening
  * Night
* Each plan highlights:

  * 🚨 Routes requiring sprinkling (high impact expected)
  * Routes where sprinkling is optional or low ROI

### 4.5 Contractor Performance Monitoring

* Tracks repeated ineffective sprinkling
* Flags skipped high-impact routes
* Generates contractor performance alerts for supervisors

---

## 5. Dashboard & UI Philosophy (Critical)

### 5.1 Design Principles

* **Map-first UI** (single source of truth)
* Minimal text, no heavy charts
* Traffic-light logic (🟢 🟡 🔴)
* Calm, operational, non-distracting

### 5.2 First Screen (No Scrolling)

All visible immediately:

* Current AQI / PM status (simple label)
* Map showing:

  * 🚨 Routes requiring sprinkling now
  * Routes ineffective yesterday
  * Ward-level status (🟢 / 🟡 / 🔴)
* Contractor performance alerts
* Today’s Morning / Evening / Night plan summary

### 5.3 Interaction Model

* Click a route → see:

  * Pre vs post impact
  * Recommendation reason (short, factual)
* No dashboards inside dashboards

---

## 6. Decision & Update Model

### 6.1 Data Refresh

* **Near-real-time updates** (every few minutes)
* Supports live monitoring

### 6.2 Decision Anchors

* Sprinkling plans remain **decision-based** (stable snapshots)
* Avoids constant plan changes that confuse operators

---

## 7. Alerting Strategy (Strict & Limited)

Alerts triggered only when:

1. Repeated ineffective sprinkling on the same route
2. High-impact route skipped
3. AQI worsening despite sprinkling

> Fewer alerts = higher trust

---

## 8. High-Level Technical Stack (Conceptual)

### Frontend

* Web-based dashboard (MVP)
* Map-centric interface

**Why:**

* Easy deployment
* Works on existing municipal hardware

### Backend

* Centralized data ingestion & processing service
* Rule-based + pattern-aware recommendation engine (no heavy AI dependency)

### Data Storage

* Time-series pollution data
* Route & ward metadata
* Contractor performance history

**Conceptual Options:**

* Time-series optimized storage (efficient PM tracking)
* Relational store for routes, wards, contractors

## 9. Conceptual Data Model

Entities (High-level):

* Ward
* Route
* Sensor Unit
* Pollution Reading (time, PM, humidity)
* Sprinkling Event (inferred)
* Impact Result (before vs after)
* Recommendation
* Contractor Performance Record

---

## 10. Security & Access Control

* Internal-use only
* Role-based access:

  * Ward Engineer
  * Senior Supervisor (future)
* No public data exposure
* Audit logs for decisions & alerts

---

## 11. Development Phases

### Phase 1 — MVP (Pilot Ready)

* Sensor integration
* Map-based dashboard
* Before/after impact logic
* Daily 3-part action plans

### Phase 2 — Optimization

* Better recommendation accuracy
* Historical effectiveness learning
* Improved contractor scoring

### Phase 3 — Expansion

* Cross-ward comparisons
* Budget optimization insights
* Policy justification reports

## 12. Potential Challenges & Mitigation

| Challenge           | Mitigation                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Seasonal relevance  | Position as winter-focused operational tool |
| Sensor noise        | Use humidity & time-window smoothing        |
| Contractor disputes | Simple, auditable logic                     |
| Tech resistance     | Advisory-only, human-in-control design      |

## 13. Future Expansion Possibilities

* Integration with traffic-light pollution sensing
* City-wide budget ROI analysis
* Construction compliance monitoring
* Policy simulation (what-if sprinkling scenarios)

## 14. Success Criteria

* Ward engineers trust and act on recommendations
* Reduced ineffective sprinkling
* Measurable AQI improvement per unit spend
* Easy explanation in audits and reviews
